# 🧬🌍 GenWorlds

GenWorlds is an open-source framework for building reliable multi-agent systems. 

Drawing inspiration from the seminal research paper ["Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442) by Stanford and Google researchers, GenWorlds provides a platform for creating flexible, scalable, and interactive environments where AI agents can exist, communicate asynchronously, interact with diverse objects, and form new memories.

Agents can also be pre-loaded with a series of memories that give them personality and helps them become subject-matter experts. This feature allows for nuanced and sophisticated interactions and behaviors. These agents communicate with the world through a WebSocket server, promoting ease of UI construction and future scalability. 

The current version of GenWorlds is powered by [OpenAI's GPT4](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4), [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html), [qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/), and was inspired by [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT).

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🌐 **Customizable Interactive Environments:** Design unique GenWorld environments, tailored to your project's needs, filled with interactive objects and potential actions for your agents.

- 🎯 **Goal-Oriented Generative Autonomous Agents:** Utilize AI agents powered by Langchain that are driven by specific objectives and can be easily extended and programmed to simulate complex behaviors and solve intricate problems.

- 🧩 **Shared Objects:** Populate your world with shared objects, creating opportunities for your agents to interact with their environment and achieve their goals.

- 💡 **Dynamic Memory Management:** Equip your agents with the ability to store, recall, and learn from past experiences, enhancing their decision-making and interaction capabilities.

- ⚡ **Scalability:** Benefit from threading and WebSocket communication for real-time interaction between agents, ensuring the platform can easily scale up as your needs grow.
