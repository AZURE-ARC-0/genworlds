# World Definition

The world definition file is the highest level configuration of the Genworlds Framework.

It allows anyone without any coding experience to set up and modify the simulation, by specifying the properties of the [World](./genworlds-framework/world.md) and the [Agents](./genworlds-framework/agents.md) and [Objects](./genworlds-framework/objects.md) in it.

The `base_agent` properties such as goals are applied to every agent in the world.
