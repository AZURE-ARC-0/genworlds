## üëÄ About

GenWorlds is the event-based communication framework for building multi-agent systems.

Using a websocket, GenWorlds provides a platform for creating interactive environments where AI agents asynchronously interact with each other and their environments to collectively execute complex tasks.

Drawing inspiration from the seminal research paper ["Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442) by Stanford and Google researchers, GenWorlds provides a platform for creating flexible, scalable, and interactive environments where AI agents can exist, communicate asynchronously, interact with diverse objects, and form new memories.

These agents communicate with the world through a WebSocket server, promoting ease of UI construction, deployment, and future scalability.

The current version of GenWorlds is powered by [OpenAI's GPT4](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4), [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html), [Qdrant](https://cloud.qdrant.io?ref=yeagerai), and was inspired by [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT).

## üìñ The Docs

Detailed information of how to use the framework can be found at [GenWorlds Docs](https://genworlds.com/docs/get-started/intro).

## üöÄ Key Features

- üåê **Customizable Interactive Environments:** Design unique GenWorld environments, tailored to your project's needs, filled with interactive objects and potential actions for your agents.

- üéØ **Goal-Oriented Generative Autonomous Agents:** Utilize AI agents powered by Langchain that are driven by specific objectives and can be easily extended and programmed to simulate complex behaviors and solve intricate problems.

- üß© **Shared Objects:** Populate your world with shared objects, creating opportunities for your agents to interact with their environment and achieve their goals.

- üí° **Dynamic Memory Management:** Equip your agents with the ability to store, recall, and learn from past experiences, enhancing their decision-making and interaction capabilities.

- ‚ö° **Scalability:** Benefit from threading and WebSocket communication for real-time interaction between agents, ensuring the platform can easily scale up as your needs grow.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Follow the Quickstart Guide

The best way to get started with GenWorlds is to follow the [Quickstart guide](https://genworlds.com/docs/get-started/quickstart).

### Run it with the Community Tooling

The easiest way to start using genworlds with a graphical UI is through the  [GenWorlds-Community](https://github.com/yeagerai/genworlds-community). Then you will be able to easily connect your `GenWorld` with a ChatGPT-like UI with different rooms for all the agents.
