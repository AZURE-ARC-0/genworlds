## üëÄ About

GenWorlds is an open-source framework for building reliable multi-agent systems.

Drawing inspiration from the seminal research paper ["Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442) by Stanford and Google researchers, GenWorlds provides a platform for creating flexible, scalable, and interactive environments where AI agents can exist, communicate asynchronously, interact with diverse objects, and form new memories.

Agents can also be pre-loaded with a series of memories that give them personality and helps them become subject-matter experts. This feature allows for nuanced and sophisticated interactions and behaviors. These agents communicate with the world through a WebSocket server, promoting ease of UI construction and future scalability.

The current version of GenWorlds is powered by [OpenAI's GPT4](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4), [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html), [qdrant](https://cloud.qdrant.io?ref=yeagerai), and was inspired by [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT).

## üìñ The Docs

Detailed information of how to use the framework can be found at [GenWorlds Docs](https://genworlds.com/docs/getting-started).

## üöÄ Key Features

- üåê **Customizable Interactive Environments:** Design unique GenWorld environments, tailored to your project's needs, filled with interactive objects and potential actions for your agents.

- üéØ **Goal-Oriented Generative Autonomous Agents:** Utilize AI agents powered by Langchain that are driven by specific objectives and can be easily extended and programmed to simulate complex behaviors and solve intricate problems.

- üß© **Shared Objects:** Populate your world with shared objects, creating opportunities for your agents to interact with their environment and achieve their goals.

- üí° **Dynamic Memory Management:** Equip your agents with the ability to store, recall, and learn from past experiences, enhancing their decision-making and interaction capabilities.

- ‚ö° **Scalability:** Benefit from threading and WebSocket communication for real-time interaction between agents, ensuring the platform can easily scale up as your needs grow.

## üõ†Ô∏è How can I use GenWorlds?

### Run it with the Community Tooling

The easiest way to start using genworlds is through the  [GenWorlds-Community](https://github.com/yeagerai/genworlds-community). This will provide you with a pre-configured environment to start fine-tuning and testing your own worlds.

#### Test it on Replit

If you want to test with different use-cases the fastest way is to use the [Replit Genworlds-Community Fork](https://replit.com/@yeagerai/genworlds-community), fork it and run it. After that, you can start playing around with the world setup in the `use_cases/rountable/world-definition.yaml` file to try out your ideas.

## Contributing

As an open-source project in a rapidly developing field, we are extremely open to contributions, whether it be in the form of a new feature, improved infrastructure, or better documentation. Please read our [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/yeagerai/genworlds/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on how to submit your contributions.

As the framework is in alpha, expect large changes to the codebase.
